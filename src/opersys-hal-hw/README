This tree shows how to add a new HAL type to Android. It's based on AOSP
2.3.7_r1 but the concepts and code likely work accross a whole wide range of
AOSPs because the inherent interfaces and bindings are fairly similar.

Files added custom are (C) Opersys inc. and are therefore easy to identify.
For the other files, look for the <ADDED-BY-OPERSYS> and </ADDED-BY-OPERSYS> to
identify what was modified/added.
